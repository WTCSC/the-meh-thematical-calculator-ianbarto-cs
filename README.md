# 🎉Calculator🎉  
====================================  
🚀 A cheeky little command-line calculator with attitude.  
🧮 It adds, subtracts, multiplies, divides, and even does exponents!  
😂 But don’t divide by zero — it *will* sass you.

## ✨ Features

- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication

And yes… it makes you wait with a dramatic "calculating..." animation.  
Because math should be suspenseful. 😏
